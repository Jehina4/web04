      <h1>Mauritian flying fox</h1>
    <p>The Mauritius Flying-fox (Pteropus niger) is not only an intriguing inhabitant of the island of Mauritius; it also serves as a crucial player in the island’s ecosystems. With their impressive wingspan and charming faces, these bats have captured the attention and affection of many nature enthusiasts. Let’s explore the fascinating world of this remarkable mammal.
     The Mauritius Flying-fox is a species of fruit bat belonging to the family Pteropodidae. These fascinating creatures play an essential role in seed dispersal and pollination, contributing to the health of the forests of Mauritius. However, like many other species worldwide, they are facing significant threats that jeopardize their survival. Understanding their behaviors, habitats, and ecological roles is vital for their conservation.</p>

      <h1>Mauritian tomb bat</h1>
      <p>Mauritian Tomb Bats are quite large for insectivorous bats, weighing as much as 36g and up to 11cm long. They occur in the moist savanna areas of north-eastern South Africa, further north into Central and East Africa, as well as on a few of the islands of the Indian Ocean. By day they roost in small, loosely associated groups on the shaded walls of buildings or on tree trunks, and not in caves or tombs as their name might suggest. At night they forage for moths and other nocturnal invertebrates, which they catch and eat in flight</p>

      <h1>Mauritian Free-tailed Bat</h1>
      <p>the Mauritius Cave Bat is unique in its own way. It is a very small bat reaching 10 grams when fully grown. The bat is a very quick flyer and barely makes any noise while in flight. Contrarily to popular belief, this bat is not blind though it prefers using its excellent echolocation skills to catch insects which constitute its exclusive diet.

This Mauritius Cave Bat is only found in caves, as its name indicates, often in colonies reaching several thousand individuals. This bat only leaves the lava tunnels during the night for foraging. A single bat can eat as much as 6000 to 8000 insects in one night! It can eat pest insects that potentially affect sugarcane and litchis.</p>

      <h1> Macaque Monkey</h1>
      <p>Long tailed macaque monkeys (often called the crab-eating macaque in south-east Asia) live well on the island of Mauritius, and are considered non-native. Portuguese sailors took them there about 400 years ago, and they find the forests just as homely as their native jungles. They are also found as far afield as Hong Kong, Palau and the medical labs. of the developed world.</p>

      <h1>Deer</h1>
      <p>The Java deer (Rusa timorensis), also known as the Javan rusa, was introduced to Mauritius by Dutch settlers in the 17th century for hunting purposes. Today, they roam freely in forests and nature reserves. Although popular among hunters, these deer can damage native vegetation and compete with local wildlife for resources, making them an invasive species</p>

      <h1>Goat</h1>
      <p>Goats were introduced to Mauritius by early settlers for meat and milk. Over time, some escaped into the wild and formed feral populations. These goats pose a threat to the island’s fragile ecosystems by overgrazing native plants, leading to soil erosion and habitat loss for endemic species. Conservation efforts aim to control feral goat populations, especially on small islets and protected areas.</p>

      <h1>Pigs</h1>
      <p>Pigs were brought to Mauritius by early European settlers as a source of food. Like goats, some pigs became feral and now live in the wild. Feral pigs can cause serious environmental damage by digging up soil, destroying native vegetation, and eating bird eggs and small animals. Their presence poses a threat to the island’s delicate ecosystems, especially in forested and protected areas.</p>
