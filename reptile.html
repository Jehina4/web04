        <p>Day Geckos as you would imagine from their name are mainly active during the
           day in contrast with most other species of Gecko. Most Day Geckos are brightly 
           coloured with vivid greens, blues, reds and oranges. An exception to this in 
           Mauritius is Gunther’s Gecko (Phelsuma guentheri), now restricted to Round 
           Island, which is greyish or greyish-brown. Day Geckos have distinctive toe pads
            that allow them to walk on vertical or overhanging surfaces. Unsurprisingly 
            Day Geckos spend a lot of time in trees. The remaining mainland species, all
             of which are much smaller than Gunther’s Gecko like to shelter in tree
              cavities and in tightly packed clusters of leaves of the type found in 
              native Palm species and Screwpines (Vacoas species) and in the introduced 
              Traveller’s palm (Ravenala madagascariensis). Day Geckos feed on insects 
              and other invertebrates and also nectar, pollen and fruits.</p>

        <div class="caption">Phelsuma cepediana </div>
        <p>Blue-tailed day geckos (Phelsuma cepediana) are a diurnal, omnivorous type of arboreal gecko primarily native 
          to Mauritius. They prefer tropical forest for habitat with plenty of rainfall, and as a strictly arboreal species,
           they spend most of their lives up off the ground.

Blue-tailed day geckos generally grow 3.75-5.5″ / 9.5-14cm long, and are among the most brightly-colored day geckos. 
 They have a bright green to blue base color, with a dark stripe on each side from the tip of the snout to the base of
  the tail, rust- to red-colored spots on the back, and darker limbs. Males are generally more colorful than females. 
  Their bodies have a sharply tapered snout, round lidless eyes, sticky toe pads, a moderate-length tail, and delicate 
  velvety skin.

Blue-tailed day geckos are particularly sensitive to improper husbandry, which makes them more difficult to care for 
and breed. Captive-bred individuals are likely to do the best as pets. When appropriate blue-tailed day gecko care is
 provided, you may expect of lifespan of up to 15+ years.</p>

        <div class="caption">Phelsuma ornata </div>
        <p>helsuma ornata commonly known as the Mauritius ornate day gecko, is as its name suggests a diurnal species of
           geckos and one of the smallest day geckos reaching a total length of 12 centimeters, with males slightly larger
            than females. Like other day geckos, they are characterized by vivid body colours. Their backs can be bluish green,
             green with a blue area on the forward part of its back or completely blue covered with red dots. The back of its
              neck and its head is greyish brown. The snout of this gecko consists of an intricate pattern of cyan, white, red 
              and dark blue while their turquoise tail bears red transversal stripes. The species are found on the island 
              Mauritius and some surrounding islets where it inhabits different trees and bushes and feeds on insects and nectar.</p>

        <p>The Telfair's skink (Leiolopisma telfairii), also known as the Round Island skink, is another critically
           important endemic reptile of Mauritius. Its story is a classic example of conservation success against 
           overwhelming odds.elfair's skinks are relatively large for a skink, reaching a total length (including tail)
            of 22-27 cm, with some sources stating up to 30-40 cm. They have a brownish-grey body often mottled with dark 
            brown spots, and their small scales can exhibit an iridescence in sunlight. They have a cylindrical body and 
            short, vigorous legs. They can also drop their tails as a defense mechanism, which later regenerates.They prefer
             vegetated palm forest and weed-based habitats, hiding among leaf litter and rocks during the hottest parts of
              the day. They are largely terrestrial but can be found climbing.</p>

        <div class="caption"> Gongylomorphus fontenayi </div>
        <p>Gongylomorphus fontenayi, often referred to as the Orange-tailed Skink or Macchabé Skink, is an endemic 
          species of skink found in Mauritius. Its taxonomic status has seen some changes, with it sometimes being 
          considered a subspecies of Gongylomorphus bojerii (as Gongylomorphus bojerii fontenayi), but recent genetic
           analyses often elevate it to full species status.t's a relatively small skink. Adult Macchabé Skinks typically 
           have a snout-vent length (SVL) of around 44-48 mm. The "Orange-tailed Skink" form, particularly the one from 
           Flat Island, is larger, with males reaching an SVL of around 68 mm and females around 50 mm.The Orange-tailed
            Skink is typically brown with an orange tinge, a bright orange ventral (belly) surface, and an orange/red tail.
             The Macchabé Skink is described as being chocolate-colored.</p>

        <div class="caption"> Cylindraspis triserrata – Domed Mauritius Giant Tortoise</div>
        <p>The Cylindraspis triserrata, commonly known as the Domed Mauritius Giant Tortoise, was one of two species of 
          giant tortoises native to Mauritius. It played a vital role in shaping the island's ecosystem.
        This species had a high, rounded shell that helped protect it from predators and environmental damage. 
        It grazed on grasses, fallen fruits, and low shrubs.Found across the main island of Mauritius and possibly 
        nearby islets.Preferred flat and forested regions.        It got extinct due to sailors and settlers captured
         and killed them for food.</p>

        <p>The Cylindraspis inepta was the second of the two giant tortoise species that once roamed Mauritius. 
          It was unique for its saddle-backed shell, which allowed it to reach higher vegetation compared to the 
          domed species.<br>
          Inhabited Mauritius, especially drier regions and lowlands.<br>
        It got extinct due to mass hunting by sailors for meat during the 1600s–1700s. and  habitat loss due to
         deforestation. </p>
