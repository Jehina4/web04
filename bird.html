    <h1>Mauritius Kestrel</h1>
    <div class="bird-desc">
    <p>The Mauritius Kestrel (Falco punctatus) is a small falcon endemic to the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. 
        Historical factors and ongoing conservation efforts have significantly influenced its habitat and distribution.
        The Mauritius Kestrel is relatively small, measuring 22 to 26 centimeters (8.7 to 10.2 inches). This compact size 
        makes it one of the smaller members of the Falcon family.
        A striking combination of colors characterizes its plumage. The upper body typically exhibits a rich chestnut coloration,
         providing excellent camouflage in forested habitats.

    <div class="bird-desc">
    <p>The pink pigeon (Nesoenas mayeri) is an endemic species from Mauritius.
        It characterized by its light pink head and underparts. Once nearly extinct, conservation programs have aided in its
         recovery, though challenges like inbreeding and habitat loss continue to threaten its survival.

    <h1>Mauritius Parakeet</h1>
    <div class="bird-desc">
    <p>The echo parakeet is a medium-sized, bright emerald green coloured parrot of about 35 cm in length and about 180 grams
         in weight. The males have a black neck collar and a red upper beak while the females have no collar and an all-black beak.
          It nests in tree cavities and on cliff faces and eats flowers, leaves and fruit of both native and introduced trees.
       The echo parakeet was once considered to be the most endangered bird in the world with a wild population of 10-12 
       individuals in 1986.
       The echo parakeet is the only one of the six known endemic Mascarene parrot species to survive extinction.
       The bird emits a variety of calls including a loud “kaaark kaaark” which is the reason for the name “echo parakeet”.

    <h1>Mauritius Cuckooshrike</h1>
    <div class="bird-desc">
    <p>The Mauritius Cuckooshrike is a small endemic arboreal passerine and lives mostly on the canopy of the upland forests 
        of Mauritius.
       Due to its small range and population, the species is classified Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. Habitat loss and exotic
       mammalian predators are the main reasons behind the decrease in its population size.
       This species feeds on arboreal arthropods and native geckos, but fruits and eggs of other bird species may be sometimes 
       part of its diet. The Mauritius Cuckooshrike is territorial all year round and monogamous. It nests in a shallow cup built
        in horizontal fork in native tree in the forest.

    <img src="images/mauritius fody.jpg" alt="Mauritius Fody">
    <h1>Mauritius Fody</h1>
    <div class="bird-desc">
    <p>The Mauritius fody is a small songbird of about 14 cm in length. Breeding males are bright red from head to chest with 
        an orange patch on the rump, while the female is a duller olive-brown colour with darker wings. It is easy to confuse 
        the Mauritius fody with the introduced Madagascar Fody which is very common in Mauritius. Breeding male Madagascar fodies
         have a completely red body. Madagascar fodies also have a thicker beak for eating seeds while the thinner beak of the 
         Mauritius fody is use to probe for insects.
       The Mauritius fody has an unusual brushed-tipped tongue which helps it to feed on nectar.
       The Mauritius fody is threatened by habitat loss and predation from introduced predators such as rats and monkeys.
        By 2001 there were perhaps as few as 100 breeding pairs remaining.
       Mauritian fodies have been translocated to Ile aux Aigrettes which has no introduced mammals apart from the Indian
        house shrew. The Mauritian Wildlife Foundation first released fodies on the island in 2003. The species has thrived 
        in the absence of predators such as rats and monkeys and now the population on Ile aux Aigrettes is about 55-60 breeding 
        pairs.

    <h1>Mauritius Bulbul</h1>
    <div class="bird-desc">
    <p>The Mauritius Bulbul is endemic to Mauritius Island where it frequents native forest and adjacent exotic vegetation.
         It feeds on fruits, animal prey, insects, and occasionally consumes flowers and nectar. It breeds during the southern 
         summer and often uses the same territory in several following years. It is resident and monogamous.
The Mauritius Bulbul is threatened by degradation and loss of the habitat, nest predation by introduced mammals and competition
 with Common Myna and Red-whiskered Bulbul. It is now confined to the remnants of the native forest.

    <h1>The Dodo</h1>
    <div class="bird-desc">
    <p>The dodo was a large flightless bird of about 1 m in height and weighing an estimated 20 kg. Two very characteristic 
        features were its small wings and large hooked beak. Despite its apparent familiarity nobody knows precisely what the dodo
         looked like as no complete specimens exist.
        The dodo, at various times, has been described as a type of swan, an ostrich, an albatross and even a vulture but 
        there is widespread agreement that the dodo was in fact a type of pigeon
        The dodo is the icon of extinction and one of the most recognised species in the world despite the fact that there
         have been no recorded observations since 1662 only 64 years after the Dutch first landed in Mauritius. Its last cited
          location was on an islet off the east coast of Mauritius, possibly Ile d’Ambre. The last record from the Mauritian 
          mainland was from 1640.
        The closest you can get to a sighting is the beautiful bronze dodo sculpture that can be seen on Ile aux Aigrettes.

    <img src="images/Broad-billed Parrot .jpg" alt="Mauritius Broad-billed Parrot ">
    <h1>Mauritius Broad-billed Parrot</h1>
    <div class="bird-desc">
    <p>The Broad Billed Parrot was a very large bird with very large heads and beaks. The males reached about 65 cm
         in height with females reaching 55 cm.Many authors who described the bird after its extinction stated that it 
         could not fly but an early account by Johann Christian Hoffman in 1673–75 states that it could fly, albeit with
          difficulty. The famous Dutch woodcut from 1601 shows the broad billed parrot high on a tree branch which would
           be an unusual position for a flightless bird. The effects of predation were probably exacerbated by reduced food 
           availability caused by the large-scale harvesting of palms.

    <p>The Mauritius Blue Pigeon, scientifically known as Alectroenas nitidissimus, once graced the idyllic landscapes 
      of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. With its mesmerizing blue plumage and vibrant red beak, it was a symbol of the 
      island’s rich biodiversity. this remarkable bird species vanished around the mid-19th century, succumbing to the 
      ravages of deforestation and hunting.

    <h1>Mauritius Night Heron</h1>
    <div class="bird-desc">
    <p>The Mauritius Night Heron (Nycticorax mauritianus) is a remarkable bird native to the lush landscapes of Mauritius,
       an island nestled in the Indian Ocean. Although this heron is notable for its secretive behavior and beautiful plumage,
        its populations have faced numerous challenges over the years. Delving into the life of this unique bird reveals a wealth 
        of fascinating insights into its behavior, habitat, and ecological role on the island.

        The Mauritius Night Heron measures about 50-60 cm in length and is characterized by its stout build and short neck. It 
        showcases a striking plumage with a combination of earthy tones—ranging from dark brown to slate gray. The breeding 
        adults exhibit a distinctive white crown that contrasts beautifully with their body. Their bright yellow eyes give them 
        a captivating gaze that is both charming and enigmatic. The birds possess a short, thick bill ideally designed for spearing
         fish and other aquatic prey.

    <img src="images/Mauritius Sheldgoose.jpg" alt="Mauritius Sheldgoose">
    <h1>Mauritius Sheldgoose</h1>
    <div class="bird-desc">
    <p>The Mauritius sheldgoose (Alopochen mauritiana), also known as the Mauritius shelduck, is an extinct species of sheldgoose
       that was endemic to the island of Mauritius. While geese were mentioned by visitors to Mauritius in the 17th century, few 
       details were provided by these accounts. In 1893, a carpometacarpus wing-bone and a pelvis from the Mare aux Songes swamp 
       were used to name a new species of comb duck, Sarcidiornis mauritianus. These bones were connected to the contemporary 
       accounts of geese and later determined to belong to a species related to the Egyptian goose and placed in the sheldgoose
       genus Alopochen.

       One contemporary account states that the Mauritius sheldgoose had wings that were half black and half white, and that 
       the bird was not very large. The species may also be depicted in one illustration. Fossil elements show that it was smaller
        than the Egyptian goose, but with more robust legs. Little is known about the habits of the Mauritius sheldgoose, accounts
        indicate they were very tame, were grazers, lived in groups, and usually stayed on the north side of the island except for
        during the dry season when they were forced to the other side to drink. Their robust legs indicate they were becoming 
        more terrestrial, which is supported by accounts stating they avoided water. The species was considered highly palatable 
        by travellers, and while abundant in 1681, it declined quickly thereafter, being declared extinct in 1698. It was
        probably driven to extinction due to overhunting and predation by introduced animals, particularly cats.

    <h1>Red Rail</h1>
    <div class="bird-desc">
    <p>Scattered among the seventeenth century written accounts and illustrations that relate to the celebrated Dodo are
       descriptions and pictures of a flightless bird of a rather different kind. These pictures show a creature that in 
       overall shape and appearance looks something like a kiwi. A long, down-curved beak, rather hair-like plumage and stout
      legs all add to this impression. The bird in question bore no genuine relationship to the kiwis, however. It was a rail
      and, like the Dodo, it came from the island of Mauritius. Like its more famous fellow, the Mauritian Red Rail or Red Hen
      failed to survive the coming of Europeans by more than a few decades.

    <img src="images/lesser noddy.jpg" alt="	Lesser Noddy">
    <h1>Lesser Noddy	</h1>
    <div class="bird-desc">
    <p>A small dark tern which appears grayish-black and extremely slender. Very similar to Black and Brown Noddies, but 
      the Lesser Noddy has a very thin bill, is somewhat paler gray overall, and has gray between the bill and the eyes.
      The flight is fast and graceful, and it often mixes with other terns. Often found offshore, not far from islands 
      in the tropical waters of the Indian Ocean.

      Lesser noddies breed annually and at the same time each year, which coincides with the southeast trade winds. Nests
       are generally constructed from leaves and seaweed, which are placed strategically on tree branches. This differs 
       from most other tern species which generally choose to nest on the ground. Although the time of egg laying may vary
        from one year to the next, it usually starts in May, with a peak in early June.

    <h1>White-tailed Tropicbird	</h1>
    <div class="bird-desc">
    <p>The White-Tailed Tropicbird, Phaethon lepturus, inhabits tropical and subtropical regions including Mauritius.
       This slender seabird measures 71-80 cm in length, its long central tail feathers extending its appearance.
       Predominantly white with black wing markings, it has a bright yellow bill.

       Breeding on rocky cliffs, it lays a single egg.

      Feeding involves diving up to 20 meters deep for fish and squid. Conservation efforts aim to counteract habitat
       loss impacts.

    <h1>	Striated Heron</h1>
    <div class="bird-desc">
    <p>A very widespread small heron, common across much of the globe. Small size and overall gray color separates 
      from most other herons and bitterns. Look for contrasting dark cap, distinct pale edges on wing feathers, and
       white and rufous stripes on front of neck. Juvenile streakier below than adult. Similar to Green Heron but note
        mostly gray neck with restricted rufous. Juvenile is much smaller and more slender than juvenile Black-crowned
         Night-Heron, with long streaks on the chest and spotting restricted to the wings. Normally solitary, found 
         standing quietly around wetland habitats such as marshes, agricultural fields, rivers, and lakes.
